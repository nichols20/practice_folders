# practice_folders

This is a folder demonstrating current projects/ challenges i'm working on daily to better understand HTML/CSS and Javascript. I'm not exactly sure why the repository won't
display that there's JS code in this folder but if you have a look at the javascript-practice folder you will be able to see different exercises i've worked on and functions
I'm building.
